# Hello! My name is Jeremy Lagunas

### Currently
I am currently participating in a **Data Science** Bootcamp provided by **CodeUp** in San Antonio, TX.
I am very excited to transition into the Data world and become a highly skilled Data Scientist who can provide immense value to any organization. 

### Navy
I have 8+ years experience in the U.S. Navy as a Nuclear Machinist Mate. 
I spent four years on the USS Tucson, a fast-attack submarine based out of Pearl Harbor, HI, where I was qualified Engineroom Supervisor (ERS). 

### About me
I play the drums, play basketball, love to eat burgers, and find myself buying books faster than I can read them.
